# Sovereign Engagement System
**Dogma in constitution, pragmatism in execution.**

A complete ethical-strategic operating system distilled from  
• The Seven Principles of Engagement (2025)  
• 7 Sovereign Principles: Ethics – The Highest Form of Strategy (2026)  
by Sebast Fock.

This repository contains the machine-readable framework and the canonical system prompt that turns any LLM into a native practitioner of the system.

### One-click usage
Copy the content of `CANONICAL PROMPT v2.1 (2025-12-10).txt` and paste it at the start of any conversation with Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, DeepSeek, Gemini, etc.

### For developers
Load `framework.yaml` into LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, LlamaIndex, or any agent framework to give your agents ethical-strategic reasoning by default.

### Real-world examples
See how the framework applies to historical corporate dilemmas: [Meta API Governance](./examples/meta_platform_api.md), [Volkswagen Emissions](./examples/volkswagen_emissions.md)

### License
